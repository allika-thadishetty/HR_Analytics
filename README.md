About the Project
- Analysing Employee Performance for HR Analytics using Python and SQL

In this project I have used a real-world dataset of the Employees' records to clean, analyse, solve business problems and mine information insights.

- Data Folder has the both cleaned and uncleaned datasets

- Used Python for cleaning and pre-processing the data.

- Used SQL to retrive useful information and analyse the data.
